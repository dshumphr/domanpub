# Project

This contains tools and data used to enable digital Doman learning. The tool will track when a concept was last taught to automatically add variety to the learning.

## Reading
- Several collections of categorized words are stored
- Display single words or couplets (TODO), as requested

## Math
- Red dots representing quantities 0-100
- Equations, again utilizing (up to) 0-100 (TODO)

The user will be expected to choose between words, couplets, quantities, and equations. All displayed elements mages should be large enough to mostly fill the screen. For equations, we may not show the entire equation at once - 1s per element is sufficient.
