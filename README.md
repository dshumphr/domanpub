# Doman Helpers

This project provides tools and data to facilitate digital Doman learning. It automatically tracks the learning process and picks the correct next session. It does NOT care about the daily breakdown of sessions, just an overall order.

This is a public repo and therefore lacks full details, like a word list, or how to use the cards. I'd recommend picking up some of the Doman books yourself if you'r einterested in the full method.

## Features

### Reading
- Multiple collections of categorized words
- Display of single words

### Math
- Visual representation of quantities (0-100) using red dots

## Usage

Run quants.py for quantities, word.py for words. Use --rerun to avoid "counting" the session.

## Coming Later
Equations, couplets, phrases, etc.
